                <p>Customers who have a winner at odds of 4/1 or bigger on Channel 4 live races will get a free bet to the equivalent stake for the following race that is shown on Channel 4. The maximum amount of the free bet is £50 and only the first single bet placed counts. The offer continues throughout the afternoon so one free bet can lead to another. If the risk free bet loses customers will have their stake returned. <br><br>Cashed bets will not be valid for the free bet but when a bet is partially closed before settlement a proportion of the stake equal to the amount not cashed out will determine the amount credited. If a single bet slips contains more than one selection for any race the one that appears highest on the slip is used to work out if a free bet is applicable. Some bets will not earn the concession and these are ones placed in ante post markets, enhanced win bets, Tote and Pari-Mutual bets and dividends and ‘Not to Win’ bets.  </p>
